# The Running Dog

A side-scrolling action game where yo play as a dog with super powers. Defeat enemies and avoid getting hit while you try to get the highest score possible within the time limit.

## Credits

The original code base was created by Frank Dvorak of [Frank's Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/@Frankslaboratory) from his lengthy tutorial on youtube [JavaScript Game Development Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFO_txvwK_c), specifically project 9 which is the final project in the series. That said, I have made many modifications and additions such as the following:

## Additions to Original Codebase

- Added multiple levels
- Added a start menu, scoreboard, credits and how to play menu screens
- Added pause and resume functionality
- Added a game over and level complete states for each level
- Added a restart level functionality
- Added a scoring system that saves each level's score in local storage
- Various small enhancements to make the code more readable/modular

## Additional Modifications Planned

- Add more enemy types/sprites with different behaviors
- Add more player states and abilities
- Add a power/stamina system to control when the player can use abilities
- Add sound effects
- Add music
- TBD
