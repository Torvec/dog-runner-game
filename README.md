# Dog Runner Game
Its a vanilla js game about a dog that runs, etc.

## Credits
The original code base was created by Frank from his lengthy tutorial on youtube [JavaScript Game  Development Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFO_txvwK_c), specifically project 9 which is the final project in the series. That said I have made many modifications and additions such as the following:
- Added pause and resume functionality
- Added a restart game functionality (will be changed to restart level in the future)
- Various small enhancements to make the code more readable/modular

## Additional Modifications Planned
- Add a start screen
- Add more than one level
- Add a more robust scoring system + scoreboards
- Add a way to save high scores
- Add sound effects
- Add music
- Add configurable settings
- TBD
