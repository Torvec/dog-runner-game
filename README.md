## Credits

The original code base was created by Frank Dvorak of [Frank's Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/@Frankslaboratory) from his lengthy tutorial on youtube [JavaScript Game Development Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFO_txvwK_c), specifically project 9 which is the final project in the series. That said, I have made many modifications and additions such as the following:

## Additions to Original Codebase

- Added 3 more levels + a final boss level for a total of 5 levels
- Added more enemy types/sprites with different behaviors so each level has different enemies
- Added projectiles that the player can shoot to defeat enemies along with an ammo system
- Added a power level system to control when the player can use the fire roll ability
- Added a start menu, scoreboard, credits, how to play, tutorial, and game complete menu screens
- Added pause and resume functionality for each level
- Added a game over and level complete states for each level
- Added a restart level functionality
- Added a scoring system that saves each level's score in local storage as well as the final score for all levels combined
- Added sound effects for projectiles, collisions, and player abilities
- Added background music with play/pause functionality
- Modified some background images to differentiate levels
